# HubDiagnostics — Code Review Findings & Fix Plan

Status as of 2026-05-08 (post-v5.13.0 ship).

Combined output of two independent reviews:
- **Codex** — external code-review pass (12 findings)
- **Internal** — verification + 10 additional findings (A1–A10)

All Codex findings were verified against the code; verdicts are recorded below.

## Detailed findings

### ✅ #6 — `childIds` includes parent IDs (fixed v5.13.1)

**Where:** `HubDiagnostics.groovy:1527` (now corrected)

**Original:** `childIds: deviceStats.parentIds + deviceStats.childIds` — concatenated the two lists.

**Fixed:** `childIds: deviceStats.childIds`.

**Symptom (resolved):** `hub_diagnostics_ui.html:797` — `mc('Child', dlistlink(s.childDevices, s.childIds))`. The "Child" metric link on the Devices tab now navigates to the actual child devices only.

**Regression guard:** test-hub-diagnostics-api.sh now asserts `len(childIds) == childDevices` AND `childIds ∩ parentIds == ∅`.

---

### ✅ #7 — `disabled` flag on `apps.userApps` always false (fixed v5.13.1)

**Where:** `HubDiagnostics.groovy:1548` (now corrected)

**Original:** `disabled: it.state == "disabled"` against a Map with no `state` key → always `false`.

**Fixed:** `disabled: it.disabled ?: false` — reads the actual Boolean from `analyzeApps`.

**User-visible impact (turned out to be smaller than first thought):** the SPA's Apps-tab Disabled badge actually reads from `apps.allApps[*].disabled`, which was sourced separately from `analyzeApps` line 2799 and was always correct. The `apps.userApps` rows array is exposed in the API response but isn't currently consumed by the SPA. So the bug existed in a dead code path; the fix is preventive (keeps the API contract correct for future SPA features and external API consumers, and matches the snapshot-view path which sources `userAppsList` directly from `analyzeApps`).

**Regression guard:** test-hub-diagnostics-api.sh now asserts `apps.userApps[*].disabled` count matches the `data.user==True AND data.disabled==True` count from `/hub2/appsList` ground truth.

---

### ✅ #1 + A1 — `/hub2/hubData` fetched 2-3× per request; `shared` Map plumbing was dead (fixed v5.14.0)

**Original callers of `/hub2/hubData`:** `fetchHubAlerts()`, `fetchSecurityInfo()`, `getHubInfo()`. (CODE_REVIEW originally also listed `fetchFirmwareUpdate` — wrong; that one hits `/hub/cloud/checkForUpdate`, not hubData.)

**Fix shipped:** new `private Map buildSharedCache(boolean includeNetwork = false)` helper pre-fetches `hubData`, `resources`, `temperature`, `databaseSize`, `hubAlerts` once per request. The three hubData consumers now accept an optional `Map prefetchedHubData = null` and skip the self-fetch when one is provided. Wired through `apiDashboard`, `apiHealth`, and (minimally) `apiNetwork`.

**Per-request hubData fetches:**
- `/api/dashboard`: 2 → 1
- `/api/health`:    2 → 1
- `/api/network`:   1 → 1 (consistency only — only `fetchSecurityInfo` consumed hubData here)

Plus `fetchSystemResources` / `fetchTemperature` / `fetchDatabaseSize` de-duplicated within each request — previously called once directly and a second time by `getStructuredAlerts`'s `?:` fallback when shared was empty.

**Resilience trade-off note (one-time hub-stress event observed post-deploy):** when hubData times out (10s), pre-R-2 the two consumers (fetchHubAlerts + getHubInfo) each made independent retry attempts, sometimes one of which succeeded. Post-R-2 both share one fetch attempt. Downstream still degrades gracefully (empty alerts, fall-back hub.hardware from `location.hubs[0].type`, null cloudController) — same UI degradation, just more deterministic now. R-4's items #12 + A8 (uniform return shape + retry) will address this resilience concern properly.

### 🟠 #3 — Audit report duplicates SPA framework

**Where:** `HubDiagnostics.groovy:4030–4393` — `renderAuditHtml` ships its own:
- CSS rules (cards, tables, summary chips, badges)
- Inline `<script>` for table sort + filter
- Open/close `<details>` collapsible card pattern

The SPA's `tbl()` (hub_diagnostics_ui.html:390), `mc()`, `ni()`, `.tbl-wrap`, `.card` classes do the same job. Future styling changes have to land in two places to stay consistent.

**Fix sketch:** extract a shared CSS/JS bundle and have the audit-report HTML reference it via inline `<style>`/`<script>` blocks pulled from constants. Or simpler short-term: move the audit's CSS into a `@Field static final String` and have both the SPA `<style>` block and the audit report consume it.

---

### 🟡 #2 — Oversized methods

**Top offenders (verified via line counting):**

| Method | Lines |
|---|---|
| `renderAuditHtml` | 363 |
| `apiForumExport` | 296 |
| `apiSnapshotDiff` | 242 |
| `analyzeDevices` | 172 |
| `analyzeApps` | 154 |

`renderAuditHtml` is the only one whose split would meaningfully improve readability — it does CSS + sections + sort/filter JS in one method. Fix is naturally implied by #3 (extract reusable parts to be shared with SPA).

The rest are coherent end-to-end pipelines — splitting them would add indirection without improving clarity.

---

### 🟡 #4 — `serveUI` sync on hot path

**Where:** `HubDiagnostics.groovy:444–449`
```groovy
long lastCheck = state.lastUIUpdateCheck ?: 0
String uiVer = getUIVersion()                    // calls downloadHubFile() — file read on every request
if (now() - lastCheck > 86400000 || uiVer == "Unknown") {
    syncUI(uiVer == "Unknown")                    // GitHub fetch
}
```

The 24-hour gate makes the GitHub-fetch path uncommon, but `getUIVersion()` runs on EVERY ui.html request — and that calls `downloadHubFile()` to read the UI from FileManager (so it can extract `const UI_VERSION = "..."` from the source).

**Fix:** cache `uiVer` in `state` after a successful sync; only re-read FileManager when `state.lastUIUpdateCheck` indicates a real check. Move the once-a-day sync into `runEveryDayAt()` instead.

---

### 🟡 #5 — Audit per-device enrichment serial after async fan-out

**Where:** `HubDiagnostics.groovy:4544` and `4557` — loops over Z-Wave nodes and Hub Mesh linked devices doing one synchronous `hubRequest` per device.

**Documented trade-off** (in v5.11.0 commit message): "for an audit that runs once a week, the few-second cost is preferable to refactoring the dispatch state machine."

**Defer until scale hurts.** Worth re-evaluating if a user reports audit times exceeding ~2 minutes on a 200+ Z-Wave-device hub.

---

### 🟡 #9 — `auditPoll` lifecycle

**Where:** `hub_diagnostics_ui.html:711–741` — `pollTimer` is closure-local; nothing clears it on tab navigation away. Multiple polls can stack up if the user clicks Generate Audit again, switches tabs, comes back.

**Fix:** track active timers in a `pollTimers` registry keyed by scanId; clear all on tab switch (already a hook point in the route map at line ~1917).

---

### 🟡 #10 — Table filter searches raw fields only

**Where:** `hub_diagnostics_ui.html:428`
```javascript
filt = rows.filter(r => cols.some(c => String(r[c.f] ?? '').toLowerCase().includes(q)));
```

For columns that use a `r:` render function (e.g. Parent column shows app name OR device name OR `-`), filtering on the visible text doesn't work — only the raw `parentAppName` field is searched. Already partially mitigated by `sf:` (sort-by alternate) on some columns but no equivalent for filter.

**Fix:** add an optional `ff:` (filter-by) column property; default to `f`; allow `r:` output for full-text search if `ff: 'rendered'` is set.

---

### 🟡 #12 — `hubRequest` weak return contract

**Where:** `HubDiagnostics.groovy:1837`

Three distinct shapes:
- text success → `String` or `null` if empty
- json success → response Map, or `{}` if `result` is null
- json exception → `[error: true, message: ...]` Map

Every caller does its own `if (!resp || resp.error) return null` dance.

**Fix sketch:** return a uniform `[ok: boolean, data: Object, error: String?]` and let callers do `if (!resp.ok) return null`. Migrating all ~40 call sites is mechanical but tedious.

---

### ⚪ #8 — Inline event handlers, `document.write`, full-container `innerHTML`

**Where:** `hub_diagnostics_ui.html:91, 92, 421, 641, 831`, plus `onclick='+r._idx+'` patterns in 3+ table renderers.

**Verdict:** works correctly today, brittle to refactor. Real cost is hidden until a substantive UI rewrite is needed. Not worth fixing in isolation — would naturally fall out of any larger SPA cleanup.

---

### ⚪ A2 — `apiSnapshotDiff` writes payload to FileManager every call

**Where:** `HubDiagnostics.groovy:904` — `saveSnapshotDiffPayload(...)`.

A 50–200 KB FileManager write per snapshots-tab refresh. The payload appears unused after writing (no read path I could find). Likely leftover from a debugging or persistence experiment.

**Fix:** remove the call, OR cache in `state` if there's a real consumer.

---

### ⚪ A3, A4, A5, A7, A8, A9, A10 — small accumulated debt

Detailed in the findings table. Each is a minor cleanup. Group as a single "house cleaning" pass when convenient.

---

## Prioritized fix plan

### Phase R-1 — Critical bug fixes (S, ~30 min) — ✅ shipped v5.13.1 (`c462801`)

Goal: ship the two real defects immediately. Both were one-line changes.

- [x] **#6 fix** — `getDevicesData()` line 1527: `childIds: deviceStats.childIds` (dropped `+ parentIds`)
- [x] **#7 fix** — `getAppsData()` line 1548: `disabled: it.disabled ?: false` (was `state == "disabled"`)
- [x] **Test guard:** value-correctness assertions added to `test-hub-diagnostics-api.sh` for both — verifies `childIds` size == `childDevices` count, `childIds ∩ parentIds == ∅`, and `/api/apps userApps[*]disabled` count matches `/hub2/appsList` ground truth
- [x] Bumped to v5.13.1; shipped via push + commit + mirror

**Verified:** 175/175 PASS on maison-pro after fixes. Note on #7's user-visible impact recorded in the detailed section above (the bug was in a code path the SPA doesn't currently consume; fix is preventive).

---

### Phase R-2 — Wire up the `shared` Map (M, ~1-2 hours) — ✅ shipped v5.14.0 (`fe7f819`)

Goal: fix #1 + A1 by completing the half-built request-scoped cache.

- [x] Added `private Map buildSharedCache(boolean includeNetwork = false)` — pre-fetches hubData, resources, temperature, databaseSize, hubAlerts; optional network/runtimeStats for heavier endpoints
- [x] Wired through `apiDashboard`, `apiHealth`, `apiNetwork` (minimal — just hubData since only `fetchSecurityInfo` consumes it there). `apiPerformance` not touched (no hubData consumer in its path).
- [x] Refactored `getHubInfo`, `fetchHubAlerts`, `fetchSecurityInfo` to accept optional `Map prefetchedHubData = null`. `fetchFirmwareUpdate` was excluded after re-verification — it hits `/hub/cloud/checkForUpdate`, not hubData.
- [x] No behavioral regression: 175/175 PASS on maison-pro after refactor.

**Trade-off note:** one timeout error observed post-deploy. Pre-R-2, two consumers each made independent fetch attempts; post-R-2 both share one. Downstream consumers still degrade gracefully — empty alerts, local fallback for hub.hardware, null cloudController. The deterministic single-attempt is the price of the call-count savings; resilience improvement (retry/backoff) is part of R-4 item #12 + A8.

---

### Phase R-3 — De-duplicate audit-report styling (M, ~1 hour) — ✅ Option A shipped v5.17.0 (`b163940`)

Picked Option A (Option A-Pragmatic, really): pull the audit's 38-line inline CSS out of `renderAuditHtml` into a single `@Field static final AUDIT_REPORT_CSS` constant near the other top-of-file `@Field`s, with a comment block flagging the SPA's `<style>` block as the parallel source of truth. Side-by-side diffability without breaking workbench / offline modes.

- [x] Audit CSS extracted to `AUDIT_REPORT_CSS` constant (38 lines)
- [x] `renderAuditHtml` shrunk from 358 → ~320 lines (also covers part of #2)
- [x] Audit report still byte-equivalent for selector content (verified key selectors round-trip)
- [x] 175/175 PASS

**Option B (extract sort/filter JS too) deliberately not taken.** Would need refactoring the audit's inline `<script>` block into a shared module; pays off only if the audit gains more interactive features. Documented as a future option in the constant's header comment.

**True single-source deduplication** (one file, both consumers) deferred — would need either (a) `serveUI` substitution that breaks workbench/offline modes, or (b) a build step (explicit non-goal). Maintenance discipline: when changing visual primitives, mirror between `AUDIT_REPORT_CSS` and the SPA `<style>` block. The constant's header comment documents this rule.

- [ ] Bump to v5.15.0 (minor)

**Verification:** generate audit on maison-pro, compare rendered HTML byte-for-byte against pre-refactor version (modulo the extracted block).

---

### Phase R-4 — Polish layer (M, batch-able)

Three batches.

**Pack 1 — resilience (v5.15.0, `a7d692c`):** ✅ shipped
- [x] **A8** — `hubRequest` retries once on SocketTimeoutException / ConnectException
- [x] **A2** — removed `saveSnapshotDiffPayload` (load fn was never called — entire feature dead)
- [x] **#4** — `getUIVersion` reads from `state.cachedUIVersion`; daily sync moved to scheduled job at 03:17

**Pack 2 — UI lifecycle (v5.16.0, `632404c`):** ✅ shipped
- [x] **#9** — `pollTimers` Map dedupes by scanId; stopPoll helper clears+removes on terminal states
- [x] **#10** — `ff:` column property on `tbl()`; Devices-tab Parent column wired so device-name search works

**Pack 3 — cleanup:**
- [ ] **#12** — uniform `hubRequest` return shape `[ok, data, error]`; ~40 callers to migrate

---

### Phase R-5 — Trivial cleanup (S) — ✅ shipped v5.18.0 (`d3c45c4`)

- [x] **A3** — invalidate `state.zwaveStackCache` (and `fwUpdateCache`) on `updated()`
- [x] **A4** — already slim from initial implementation (6-field result Map, not raw response); verified
- [-] **A5** — **deferred** — true fix needs the snapshot/checkpoint delete API to take a stable id (timestamp/filename) rather than an array index; that's API contract work, not housekeeping
- [x] **A7** — `apiTimings.clear()` on `updated()`
- [x] **A9** — `_schemaVersion: 1` added to `extractAuditFields` output for forward compat
- [x] **A10** — `tbl()` header click now re-renders `<tbody>` only; preserves filter focus + details state; faster on large tables

---

## Explicit non-goals (accepted trade-offs)

- **#5** (`finalizeAudit` serial enrichment) — defer until a user reports slowness on a Z-Wave-rich hub. Documented trade-off from the v5.11.0 commit.
- **#11** (`MOCK_DATA` in production) — 4% of file size, used by the workbench mode; cost is negligible vs. the dev convenience.
- **#2** for methods other than `renderAuditHtml` — `analyzeDevices`/`analyzeApps`/`apiForumExport`/`apiSnapshotDiff` are coherent pipelines; splitting would add indirection without improving clarity.
- **Larger SPA architecture rewrite** (e.g., introducing a component framework, build step, state-management layer) — explicit non-goal. The "single static HTML file with no build step" model is a feature, not a bug; it's what makes the app installable in 30 seconds with no dev tooling.
